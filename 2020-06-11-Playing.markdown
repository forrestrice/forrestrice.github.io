Haven't had a chance to post-mortem this week's QT game, but will try to do so tomorrow. Played on each of the last 3 days:
Tuesday: ~20 boards with Wes, Trevor, Brian, and Matt
Wednesday: 12 board daily IMP robot tournament. Finished +17
Thursday: ~10 boards with Chris, Leah, and Eli

In other news it looks like my embedded twitch videos broke because I haven't enabled HTTPS. I'll have to look into that this weekend.
