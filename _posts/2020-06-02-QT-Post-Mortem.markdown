chuhchung06/02/2020
strongly prefer :1H:
forrest06/02/2020
yeah i was going to ask about that
chuhchung06/02/2020
and east's :2C: call should be NF
as a general rule, prefer to overfcall the 5cM instead of doubling
forrest06/02/2020
yeah i thought i remembered you saying that before
but if double should be focused on the majors like we talked about yesterday
why not use that?
chuhchung06/02/2020
the problem is you will never find your 5-3 fit after this start
forrest06/02/2020
right
chuhchung06/02/2020
but if you overcall you often have the option of doubling later
also a strike against double - this hand is just pretty weak in high cards
so if partner passes....
forrest06/02/2020
yeah makes sense
chuhchung06/02/2020
heh, cute hand
i'm sure i would muck this up irl thru carelessness
oh i guess you're sort of still short an entry (or clubs don't break)
poop
i was thinking you could afford to check for 4-0 trumps onside
so win the SA at T1, cash the top diamond
and you can pick up 4-0 onside, but you have to overtake the club
i guess that means you can hook the club later. hahahahah
oh god. mayber declarer is really supposed to play for that given your double
ok whatever they're in 3D with a billion top tricks. io'll stop caring now
forrest06/02/2020
haha yeah
chuhchung06/02/2020
i can convince myself of it. i'm not sure i'd have the guts to do it...
declarer knows you have a diamond void, so you must have some 5404ish type of hand (otherwise wtf?)
so when the CT falls out of your partner, he repeats the diamond hook, it looks awfully right to try a club to the 8 now....
so SA. DA. spade to K. diamond finesse (mark splits)
CK overtaken, repeat the diamond finesse and draw trumps
club to the 8
13 tricks for a - because we're in 3D
lol
forrest06/02/2020
i think you gave dummy 3 diamonds there
chuhchung06/02/2020
OH
hi
ok i am not finessing diamonds imediately. NEXT

forrest06/02/2020
http://www.bridgebase.com/tools/handviewer.html?bbo=y&myhand=M-3481468728-1591062304 this one i got a phone call during the bidding and messed up
thought they opened 1d not mark
chuhchung06/02/2020
sounds like me playing during work
agh
please tell mark not to play DT at T1
also S8 at T2
finessing dummy's J
you should also not come out C9 when you're in haha
mark should also shift to HT instead of a club
have i picked apart this hand enough yet?
forrest06/02/2020
yeah i figured out that was bad after i did it
re c9
would you lead dJ?
chuhchung06/02/2020
nah
H2 for me
forrest06/02/2020
yeah in hindsight that also seemed bad
chuhchung06/02/2020
so i guess to summarize
1) diamond lead seems bad. singleton in partner's "suit" usually doesn't fare well. usually opponents have the length on this sort of auction
2) don't signal with a trick (DT)
3) finesse dummy's honor (8, not Q). mark basically has to hope that you have some holding to the T9. going in Q is really bad when declarer has K... and if you have the K, declarer now has a finesse against you anyway
4) club shift is bad. we know declarer doesn't have 4 hearts (auction) so we can safely go after hearts here
5) return the C2, original 4th. mark has a chance of getting it right now by ducking the trick entirely (COUNT!)
to emphasize point 1, if partner opened 1M i would still not lead their suit if i had a small stiff. stiff honor.... yea probably. otherwise definitely just lead my own 5 card suit. surprise!
forrest06/02/2020
looking
chuhchung06/02/2020
@HeavyDluxe look i'm a big ol meanie
forrest06/02/2020
re 5) - what's the general rule for how that works
if i lead a new suit, lead as if it were opening lead?
err i guess it's not a new suit
chuhchung06/02/2020
when partner shifts to a suit (attitude), we make our mandatory 3rd hand play
then, we continue as if returning partner's opening lead
assuming there's no technical issue at hand (like having to unblock, or holding a trick, blah blah)
so high from remaining doubleton, or low/4th from original 4/5. sometimes even low from original 5
forrest06/02/2020
"when partner shifts to a suit (attitude)" - you mean this is an attitude situation because partner led the suit or something else
like if mark played the A i'd show attitude
chuhchung06/02/2020
no, attitude shifts in the middle of the hand
when shifting to a new suit, lo shows interest, hi denies interest
afaik this is standard
forrest06/02/2020
ah ok - even playing right-side-up?
chuhchung06/02/2020
yes
upsidedown or upsideup, it's always this way
don't ask me why
i guess because it works
forrest06/02/2020
it's like top of nothing
chuhchung06/02/2020
yes
forrest06/02/2020
i suppose
chuhchung06/02/2020
so if dummy has the beautiful xxx and mark decides to attack it, he needs to give you his attitude
that way, when you have something like KQxx, you'll know whether to return the suit or not
if mark shifts hi, you win your Q and sit there and wait for the encore
if mark shifts low, you win your Q and return it (ORIGINAL 4th!)
forrest06/02/2020
got it
chuhchung06/02/2020
oh one more thing about the S8 play
it's easily the one that's least clear. but it's good to learn the foundation so we know when to violate it
and that one's one of the tougher principles
forrest06/02/2020
yeah i see why it makes sense looking at this hand
at the table the 8 feels really low
chuhchung06/02/2020
with the 0 gapper it is obvious (QT over J)
1 gapper i think it is "clear" once it's been shown to you (Q9 over J)
it extends to even lower spots too... but now it's getting more and more about hand reading and consturction

wow west is really passive
forrest06/02/2020
yeah i don't really get double from east either
chuhchung06/02/2020
yea...
forrest06/02/2020
i would assume double would show 2 hearts or something?
chuhchung06/02/2020
i think double shows "i would have raised to :3H:"
but, well, that's an insane evaluation :stuck_out_tongue:

```
forrest06/02/2020
Wasn't sure how to apply invite soundly here
since mark isn't for sure 12-14 balanced (though he could be)
chuhchung06/02/2020
i just rebid 1N
which in effect shuts down partner when he is 12-14
haha
forrest06/02/2020
haha
ok so here i bid :1N: and mark just bids :3N: ?
or invites w/ 2n?
i guess we have at least 24 so you just bid it
chuhchung06/02/2020
can just kick it in
2N is fine too. doesn't matter too much
forrest06/02/2020
i transported back to my hand to take the d hook but that was a waste since E has JT
chuhchung06/02/2020
you should also cash the diamond suit differently
everyone teaches "high card from the short side" but that's simply wrong :/
it should be, final card from the short side
forrest06/02/2020
yeah i can see that here
chuhchung06/02/2020
so cash DA first. if an honor falls out of W, cross to the Q. now you are in the correct hand already
so it's final card from the short side
really dislike E's lead
i would lead a heart... the H4. which loses a trick in a much more hilarious fashion
forrest06/02/2020
i remember thonking after winning the DK and figured out i needed to play CK now to get a club trick if they split 3-3
so that was good I think
chuhchung06/02/2020
:thumbsup:
yeah you took a good numbah of tricks
forrest06/02/2020
i assume club was just "the unbid suit"
but yeah i'd lead a heart or a diamond
probably heart
chuhchung06/02/2020
don't be afraid to lead the suits where they just make a 1 over 1 response
we bid it on 4 little. just attack
i won't be intimidated!
forrest06/02/2020
yeah and you really get em if they psyched to prevent it
chuhchung06/02/2020
too often it's just your suit to play
forrest06/02/2020
not that i have to worry about that much
chuhchung06/02/2020
yeah, the psych isn't that frequent. even against me :stuck_out_tongue:
it's just your trick source. gotta play it
and fwiw, when leading from a 5 card suit into declarer's 4 card suit, lead 5th
often you cannot spare the 4th spot
forrest06/02/2020
makes sense
and it would make sense for parter to play you for 5 even if you led the 2
chuhchung06/02/2020
yes
forrest06/02/2020
since they showed 4
chuhchung06/02/2020
otherwise why did i lead it
yep
honestly i probably lead low too much from HH9
should try the big one more. it works here...
but from HHxxx, def small
ok. mental note to lead H from HH9xx
forrest06/02/2020
yeah some people made 12 tricks on a heart lead and then misdefense
but whatever
chuhchung06/02/2020
you only have 8 tricks on the HK lead right? what a difference
you will test diamonds, womp womp, hook the club, down we go
go down 2 even

forrest06/02/2020
this one was hairy
do you subscribe to the RULE OF 15?
and should E open 1 or 2 diamonds?
chuhchung06/02/2020
i would 2
forrest06/02/2020
i figured out to play W for CQ because E opened the hand with AKQ
which makes it much easier to count points than normal
chuhchung06/02/2020
and i would pass with mark's hand, not really rule of 15 or anything. i don't subscribe to that
it's just a pretty bad hand heh
though i do think most 4th seat hands are openers
and yeah nice work
forrest06/02/2020
most 4th seat hands are openers - what do you mean by that?
just generally if gets around to you
you will probably have enough?
chuhchung06/02/2020
yeah sort of. and 2nd seat is the most conservative so maybe your partner has the best hand out of the 3 players. and if you're better than the opps then you want to play the hand
lol
this is just a bad hand though, and vul undertricks are pricey

chuhchung06/02/2020
:1H: is fine
just pass :1S:
our hand is bad and we want the auction to be over
have a ruffing value in :1S:
don't give stupid partner a chance to bid again
forrest06/02/2020
haha right
well
:1S: is limited to 17 or 18 right?
chuhchung06/02/2020
yeah
forrest06/02/2020
k then yeah
chuhchung06/02/2020
on the previous auction where you had 11 and bid :2N:
that's the one where i bid :1N:
and it should have some reasonable values because often we can just drop partner and not bid :1N:
or rebid our suit with a truly hopeless hand, etc
reaosnablke being like, i dunno, 8-11

nice bid mark!
feels unlucky that it's not cold. also omg E found the duck
forrest06/02/2020
yeah
and he hesitated
my one viewer pointed out if i think he ducked i can run off diamonds and clubs and endplay him
chuhchung06/02/2020
ah yeah you can consider it with the hesi
it's a tough play though
forrest06/02/2020
yeah i thought about running diamonds
then figured out i needed the spade hooks
and then didn't revisit it
got a nice zero for that one
so is it right to duck? Dummy is pretty scary
chuhchung06/02/2020
ducking is probably right, but it has to be in tempo
squeeze/strip squeeze technique is probably not quite worth talking about yet though
haha
i'm not even that good at strip squeezes myself. certainly not while autoplaying
oh you dont have the entries to manage it if he doesn't duck
see this is hard
lol
forrest06/02/2020
if he doesn't duck doesn't that mean i can't afford to throw him in? Or it then just becomes a regular squeeze?
chuhchung06/02/2020
so usually it's right to duck because you don't want to rectify the count (setting up the stage for a squeeze)
you need a second heart in dummy for the squeeze to operate ithink
if there's a second heart in dummy then ducking in tempo is the only chance. i think.
DON'T KNOW
yeah,.
east is in trouble if you have a second heart
he'll be squeezed in between hearts and spades
you'll cash the SQ, leaving the ST menacing his SJ
in the 3 card ending, dummy has ST Hx Dx and you have Sx HAJ
you cash the diamond and discard the spade from your hand
E has to come down to 2 cards... and he's holding SJ HQx
so he has to yield
so ducking is right when you don't have the entry problem (aka no heart entry)
i think you can still succeed on a strip squeeze anyway though. @thymepuns help i'm bad at bridge
IN ANY CASE this is probably not worth the effort at the moment

wasn't sure about :3C: - i figured we had the balance of strength and mark might have some decent hearts
but i'm 5-5
chuhchung06/02/2020
yeah i would fight for it
and this fits my rule of "3m bids in competition are nf"
forrest06/02/2020
how about going for the D ruff?
blows a trick here
chuhchung06/02/2020
ok i see it
i generally stay away from Ax leads unless partner is known to have a 5 card suit
