declarer misplayed this
not sure what the opening lead should be
DA seems ok
normally with long trumps i'd be hesitant to ruff the second diamond
but it felt like mine were so bad that it wouldn't matter
but maybe that's just wrong
and i guess there's some chance declarer had Qx
hmm i guess not
if ace was led
chuhchung07/30/2020
mark should really continue  a diamond higher than dummy's spot
forrest07/30/2020
haha yeah
chuhchung07/30/2020
and when dummy puts up a winner,  i ruff
so don't worry about that
there's like, one scenario where it's wrong
otherwise just ruff winners
forrest07/30/2020
yeah ok - just don't want to give overruffs on air
chuhchung07/30/2020
yes, but this is a winner
you killed the DK
that's a trick declarer doesn't get
it's like covering an honor
forrest07/30/2020
right
i feel like going after spades is a mistake that's pretty easy to make (for me)
though i wouldn't lead the queen
so i guess that was the real problem
but here's where it's real bad to do so
chuhchung07/30/2020
it's just a really bad play
doesn't accomplish anything and exposes you to ruffs
just draw trumps

forrest07/30/2020
this raise didn't seem reasonable to me
i guess if you think i'm 6-5?
even then it's not an invite
but maybe it is if i reverse
so not sure
but we have a 9 card club fit at least
chuhchung07/30/2020
i think you should have more shape, but yes, the raise is really bad
on the actual hand i would double with yours
as for the auction, after :2S:, i would just cue with mark's hand
"strong hand, no clear direction"
aka what the default meaning of cues should be :stuck_out_tongue:
forrest07/30/2020
i guess it's a tiny bit confusing
since in a vacuum i wouldn't consider his hand worth a cue, but maybe it is opposite and opening and a reopening double
is it forcing to game or not necessarily?
chuhchung07/30/2020
i'm talking about after you bid :2S:, his hand is a maximum
so he just has to FG
forrest07/30/2020
oh ok i thought you meant after i doubled
chuhchung07/30/2020
after the double he can bid :3C:, promising values
:2N: should be leb
idk if that's standard. but it should be
it's what coffee and i play
forrest07/30/2020
ok same principle as using it over a reverse i suppose
though does that mean :2N: is also leb over :2S:?
chuhchung07/30/2020
yes
and i would say sam eprinciple as if they opened a weak 2, but that's probably just a semantics thing :stuck_out_tongue:
forrest07/30/2020
well they opened a weak 2 and opener reversed
all on the same hand
haha
chuhchung07/30/2020
yeah

forrest07/30/2020
This isn't a double unless i switch clubs and hearts for you
i guess he's just power doubling
so maybe that's fine
chuhchung07/30/2020
doonnn''t't't't't douibleleelelelek
forrest07/30/2020
though we're pretty high
chuhchung07/30/2020
you will never ever ever EVER know what to do when partner bids :4H:
at some point you will be so strong that you double and hope if partner bids :4H: it makes on brute force
but this hand isn't up there
forrest07/30/2020
i thought about cueing but figured i was a little too weak
idk what you think
chuhchung07/30/2020
your hand is in a tough spot
i would just bid :4C:
cue should be no clear direction - in your case, it does have a clear direction: clubs
it's sad that we have so many values, but :5C: feels like an overbid, partner may have stretched, minors are sketchy, etc etc
forrest07/30/2020
right
well over a 1 level take out double I thought advancer cued to show forcing/good hand
not necessarily no clear direction
chuhchung07/30/2020
sort of
but if you have something like AKxxx Axx x Jxxx over partner's takeout double of :1H:, i wouldn't cue
would just bash :4S:
clear direction
but if partner doubles 1D and you have 4-4 majors and a good hand, that's a cue
i think my principle still holds
i guess it breaks when you have  a slam try. but basics first
and these days i just take out all ambiguity by bidding 5M for my slam try.
that way you'll never have to guess if partner is control bidding for you when we never even fucking agreed a suit explicitly
it drives me a little nuts
forrest07/30/2020
yeah not too many slams after they open anyway
chuhchung07/30/2020
yeah
it'll be more relevant if they preempt
but like i said, i just bash 5 or 6
anyway, mark can just bid :3S:
forrest07/30/2020
presumably i raise to game
chuhchung07/30/2020
yes
mark forced the high trump
it's irrelevant, but it's still a scary habit
generally there's nothing to worry about when they're down to the lone high trump
you just go along as if they're all gone (there's like.... 2 exceptions to this rule)
forrest07/30/2020
setting up a long suit when you don't have transportation
and?
chuhchung07/30/2020
endplay
1 trump out, you merrily go on your way, he never ruffs in, the hand is stripped
ok, here you go! your turn

forrest07/30/2020
Supposed to be :double: or :pass:?
pretty ugly 6
chuhchung07/30/2020
i would pass
your hand can stand to bid :3S: btw
18-19 bal opposite partner's 1 level response can just raise to 3
forrest07/30/2020
so we discussed responding light a bit
but i guess was thinking responding over their overcall wouldn't be light
chuhchung07/30/2020
yes
forrest07/30/2020
so therefore 19 should bid game
but it can still be thin
chuhchung07/30/2020
oh, yeah
but otherwise just bid 3 :stuck_out_tongue:
forrest07/30/2020
:thumbsup:
chuhchung07/30/2020
honestly i would probably still bid 3 here just to give partner an out
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
but it's fine
forrest07/30/2020
yeah doubtful to miss
worst case is like 7 points or something

Chat was advocating that texas should always be on
idk if we even play texas normally yet
currently we just play natural over interference
chuhchung07/30/2020
lol. thanks stream monsters.
go to hell
and texas is definitely NEVER always on
standard is that it is off if :4D: is a cuebid
like they interfere with 3D
:4H: is NOT texas, because :4D: is not texas
btw have i mentioned that in my system, we have a unified way of handling ALL of these scenarios, in a consistent, logical, memorable way?
:money_mouth: :money_mouth: :money_mouth:
forrest07/30/2020
transfers?
chuhchung07/30/2020
yeah
anyway, :4S: was fine
mark can get a little vig by drawing trumps ending in dummy so he can cash one high diamond
might as well not blow it to stiff DQ off
or draw trumps ending in hand and cash a high diamond. whatever.
forrest07/30/2020

i stripped the hand
was maybe a little sketchy
was planning to pitch diamonds on the hearts
chuhchung07/30/2020
i would be worried about giving up the club ruffj
i don't think pitching two diamonds helps you much right
forrest07/30/2020
i guess i was worried about needing ruffs
but the hearts are good enough
chuhchung07/30/2020
you're just gonna fail no matter what if the DA is offside
lose at least 1 spade, 1 heart, two diamonds
so we'll just play as if diamonds behave. similary, we need spades to behave... haha
so i would just start SA and another immediately and pray
forrest07/30/2020
:thumbsup:
chuhchung07/30/2020
aiming3 spade tricks, 1 ruff is 4, 3 hearts is 7, 3 clubs is 10, diamond is 11 (except all those losers)
forrest07/30/2020
so i'd bid 4 with Mark's hand as well
chuhchung07/30/2020
yeah it's fine
forrest07/30/2020
but say he were 4333
is it just an invite then?
i guess the bidding would be different
chuhchung07/30/2020
yeah
inviting is probably fine
it's not that important
haha
the real question would be, how d owe get to 3N vs 4M when it's right
forrest07/30/2020
i assume 4SF is the normal answer
we haven't really covered that
chuhchung07/30/2020
i don't even know if that wil help
just throw my hands in the air and guess

we played :4S: 6 hands in a row
it's a good contract! .... sometimes
chuhchung07/30/2020
too bad you didn't murderize :2D:
mark played it well!
forrest07/30/2020
wow i didn't notice how bad :2D: would be
you get like 3 tricks at most or something
chuhchung07/30/2020
yes
it's a suicidal call
absolutelyinsane
forrest07/30/2020
so should Mark double?
chuhchung07/30/2020
standard forcing pass is that double is penalty so he would have to pass
and then you can smack it
but you can just invert it. double is takeout
tada
forrest07/30/2020
haha
chuhchung07/30/2020
bridge bidding is medieval
forrest07/30/2020
well we aren't in a game force
if it matters
chuhchung07/30/2020
you're still in a force
there's no way you can let your opponents play 2m with 23+ hcp in a forcing auction
forrest07/30/2020
right

I should just open this :1N: right?
chuhchung07/30/2020
yes
forrest07/30/2020
are there any clues i missed on how to play hearts?
i guess i know E has a singlton diamond
so that's a pretty big tilt in that direction
but since they did ruff, playing for the drop works in every case except 0-4 w/ E
oh no could be 3-1
but if they are 3-1 i can play the HK
and learn that

there's a simple answer to this :slight_smile:
i just won't play E for two singletons
so cash HA
