i'm thinking mark should just pass :2S:
chuhchung07/22/2020
oh yeah bigtime
forrest07/22/2020
idk if i'm worth more than :2S:
chuhchung07/22/2020
here's a good rule - never run to 2N on sub-invitational auctions (and often not even in invitational auctions...)
forrest07/22/2020
:thumbsup:
i also misplayed it (after a very helpful lead)
SA should just be ruffing a club

I don't think i would have bid :2H: as north but figured i'd check
they made a bad reverse to get too high so we got a 100
chuhchung07/22/2020
yea it's a pass
forrest07/22/2020
if favorable?
chuhchung07/22/2020
i would still pass but it would less disgusting then
i really need a shortness when the hand is that bad...

seems fine to me to go to 3 with Mark's hand
but it ended up being a loser
maybe he can play it better let me look
oh yeah i mentioned to him that I don't think he should draw the SQ - try to get a heart ruff first
chuhchung07/22/2020
yea competing is fine. his line is........ bad
forrest07/22/2020
but maybe you're not even supposed to play the K?
yeah looks like i want to maintain control until i pitch hearts
chuhchung07/22/2020
duck T1
the hand is automatic for -1 after that
which is fine.
forrest07/22/2020
yeah -1 is 70%
chuhchung07/22/2020
monay
forrest07/22/2020
so duck trick one so that they don't get in twice to draw trumps
chuhchung07/22/2020
yeah you could also win T1 and just return it
same thing
forrest07/22/2020
though here we only need one ruff
chuhchung07/22/2020
it's just Yet Another Common Pattern
forrest07/22/2020
but in general we might need more
chuhchung07/22/2020
ducking tends to be the stronger pattern, but win and back it often works too
forrest07/22/2020
yeah and here you know there is almost no danger of a ruff as well

:3N: or :4H:?
spades are a liability either way i realized
chuhchung07/22/2020
if you follow my rules, :2N: establishes a GF so hyou can bid :3H: in peace
but if i had to simply make a decision with your hand, i would shoot out :3N:
that's the cost of not having established a clear GF
forrest07/22/2020
right
chuhchung07/22/2020
after hearing :3H: with mark' hand, i would also try :3N: by N
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
forrest07/22/2020
yeah i felt like :3N: was where we probably belonged
but talked myself out of it
interestingly only 1 table played it in NT - 12 in hearts
but i agree w/ you
chuhchung07/22/2020
4M vs 3N is one of the toughest bidding problems actually!
forrest07/22/2020
i read something on BW that made sense to me. If you are barely at game or have a few points extra then 3N tends to be better. If you are right at 26-27 then 4M is often better
obviously depends on shapes
chuhchung07/22/2020
i have two rules for this
1) overstrength (think 28.5-30 hcp) wants to play 3N instead of 4M (your first sentence)
2) 5332 opp 4333 wants to play 3N. 4333 opp 4432 wants to play 4M
so the second half of your sentence, i have it based purely on shape
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
but if you diagnose extreme weakness in a suit, then obviously prefer 4M

A viewer was questioning Mark opening
seemed auto to me
chuhchung07/22/2020
third seat it's auto
even struck gold!
oh you should probably double
:2H: bid is for people like me and @coffee who play it NF
i mean not that your bid is F because PH, but traditionally it's stronger
forrest07/22/2020
right
chuhchung07/22/2020
what a lead
forrest07/22/2020
yeah we had discussed negative double with 5 when too weak to overcall
so i'm normally showing 10-11 here?
chuhchung07/22/2020
yeah
not sure if we should be drawing trumps so cavalierly
we need an awful lot of ruffs in dummy

not quite sure how the auction should go
:4D: feels too aggro
chuhchung07/22/2020
:4D: is NUTS
NUTS NUTS NUTS
partner announced 5-5, you took a preference, and partner has the SAME 5-5 and decides to compete more

chuhchung07/22/2020
i would double and sell to :2S: but they just always bid 1 more :stuck_out_tongue:
forrest07/22/2020
haha
this was another one that dan had an opinion on
"clear 1N"
or something
chuhchung07/22/2020
:1N: might be ok because of the strong club suit but i really hate bidding it with minimums opposite a PH
having strong opinions is the mark of a bridge player
forrest07/22/2020
Danlieb:@otterlyamazin He got a gift. Lucky his partner didn’t jump in hearts
OtterlyAmazin:True—hearts would have been certainly penalty doubled and we would be thinking oh no this ain’t it
Danlieb:Your double
Danlieb:Hand was 1N at MPs 100% of the time
Danlieb:The lead was coming at you. You had running tricks, some tricks from partner.
i'm thinking if partner jumps in hearts then he probably has hearts...

forrest07/24/2020
this should be a club lead right?
should i play the d9?
or 6 is actually better if i'm going to play the 9
the 5 is already forcing the queen haha
chuhchung07/24/2020
i lead aggressively vs preempts
i would have chosen D5 as well
DJ is normal
third hand plays high
you only play an intermediate if you are finessing something in dummy
aka surrounding something
your J9 has nothing surrounded
so play high
6 i guess is possible but those deep late spots are usually not going to matter, especially if you think partner has 4D
forrest07/24/2020
yeah was mostly just an amusing point of the hand
chuhchung07/24/2020
HQ by mark is weird
i mean it doesn't matter here, but it's weird
forrest07/24/2020
yeah not sure what the logic of that one was
so lead aggressively against preempts because partner is more likely to have strength vs declarer than a normal auction
or because our winners are more likely to go away?
chuhchung07/24/2020
both
btw i don't even know if this is right. it's just what i do :stuck_out_tongue:
but it's been my experience a lot that if you try to lead from a nothing suit, you'll find that dummy has a huge chunk of that suit
and now you're behind in the tempo game
don't ask me why it seems to happen all the time. selective memory?
forrest07/24/2020
sort of makes sense but hard to say - dummy is more likely to have some holding in a suit that they couldn't show
chuhchung07/24/2020
i gave this advice to guplex back when he was still relatively new
then we defended a preempt, and he chose to lead his small doubleton instead of something aggrro
dummy hit with AKT98x
i had QJ tight behind, declarer wasn't paying attention to spots so she finessed the second round
but..... CONFIRMATION BIAS HO!

a bunch of people let this make the same way our opponents did
seems pretty bad
also should i push for us to use inverted minors or doesn't really matter
chuhchung07/24/2020
perverted minors don't matter too much
more important things to worry about
GOOD LORD what a defense
SK at T2 is just ?????????
well, should be SK first. but whatever
forrest07/24/2020
you prefer at T6 :stuck_out_tongue:
chuhchung07/24/2020
LOL
well to be fair the hand may be stripped at that point
forrest07/24/2020
wasn't
but could be
i suppose
didn't see that - good to look out for for the mirrored hands
chuhchung07/24/2020
yes, it's something i yell at @coffee to notice immediately
big pattern is - 4+ trumps in both hands, mirrored (or mostly mirrored) pattern, immediate reaction should be "i probably need to strip this hand"
unlucky that declarer has S9. otherwise E can pushes a spade thru

http://www.bridgebase.com/tools/handviewer.html?bbo=y&myhand=M-201717061-1595295907 here :2S: turns out to be too high already (but -1 is a fine score)
:2H: is clearly crazy
but how's :3C:?
I remembered that A 4th in their suit is pretty good but i'm 4333
would you do anything differently if you hear a neg double instead?
chuhchung07/24/2020
i don't think Axxx is super great or anything
this is definitely just a simple raise for me
partner can come in on all kinds of shit... i'm not gonna force to the 3 level with a flat hand with only 3 card support
i just raise to :2S: in both cases. but at least you have a case for making a cue-raise if they double, since you can still get out in 2
forrest07/24/2020
:thumbsup:
chuhchung07/24/2020
give me not-4333 and i'd probably cue. it's one of those yet again where i just don't care that much :stuck_out_tongue:

most people got the spade overcall so found their 4-4 heart fit
oh i can just bid :2H: with this
forgot that i don't need 5 for m-m auction
or am i confusing that w/ something else
chuhchung07/24/2020
nah you need 5
forrest07/24/2020
is the the 1-1-1 auction where you can have 4?
chuhchung07/24/2020
yes
forrest07/24/2020
ok
chuhchung07/24/2020
1 level 4, 2 level 5
is actually fairly consistent with a lot of bidding systems
you just have to double with this hand
or pass
i prefer pass
forrest07/24/2020
2nt is what 10-12?
chuhchung07/24/2020
bump it to 11
forrest07/24/2020
ok so same as :1C::pass:
that's easy enough
chuhchung07/24/2020
yes
makes sense right?
why would you want to be higher in the face of interference
haha
LOL just noticed that he overcalled 2C with that hand
forrest07/24/2020
well not about wanting to be
chuhchung07/24/2020
i was looking at the play and i was thinking "you probably shouldn't ruff the spade because he -- overcalled what!?"
forrest07/24/2020
you have to be (if you want to bid)
chuhchung07/24/2020
pass exists :stuck_out_tongue:
overall nice defense
can't believe declarer decided to dump an extra heart trick in your lap
passing with length in the opponents suit when you have mediocre hands is pretty much always fine
partner will reopen with shortness
and if partner can't, then they're in trouble
forrest07/24/2020
yeah once i knew the clubs and the diamonds were each 5-0
it was fairly clear
though apparently in this position i'm supposed to let him get his c9
chuhchung07/24/2020
yeah that's the thing i was thinking about
except it's kind of crazy, because he's not really supposed to have that hand...
would never play him for 5S
lol
that was my comment above where you shouldn't ruff the spade, before i realized "HUH? how can he have that hand"
etc
forrest07/24/2020
right
well if he is 4405 does it change anything
looking
he is marked with 5 actually
because partner has at most 4 from :1D:
chuhchung07/24/2020
oh you're right
these are the sorts of hurdles i have trouble overcoming in the play
when someone has a proven impossible shape and i just haven't processed it yet
forrest07/24/2020
but if were 4405 then i'd want to ruff a spade and draw trumps more so that partner's spades would be set up
is that the idea?
chuhchung07/24/2020
i was just thinking he's out of tricks
i didn't think that hard :stuck_out_tongue:
forrest07/24/2020
i should make sure to use this for counting minimum length more frequently
lot easier to visualize their hand
