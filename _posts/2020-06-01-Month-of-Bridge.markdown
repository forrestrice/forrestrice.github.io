Welcome to the first edition of my newest quarantine project: The Month of Bridge! My goal is play, read, discuss, or program bridge every day in the month of June. For each of those days I will write a brief journal entry here, and if I am feeling especially ambitious I will post some analysis. Since today was a Monday, my regular partner Mark and I played in our club [Quicktricks'](https://www.quicktricks.org/) online game. I've been streaming these since the start of the quarantine, and the VODs are available on my [twitch page](https://www.twitch.tv/forax1769).
