On friday I recapped a few hands with Chris. On Saturday and Sunday I played BBO robot games.

Think i underbid this one - not sure if a void in their suit should push me more towards being preemptive or constructive
chuhchung06/12/2020
i probably would've bid 2 :stuck_out_tongue:
partner's only overcalling
they don't have to have all that much
the defense was weak
forrest06/12/2020
hmm interesting - i was assuming i should bid at least 3 since i thought i should be willing to compete that high
chuhchung06/12/2020
yeah that's fine
i wasn't gonna compete that much
can you see the defensive improvement?
(don't gib!)
also, i didn't even realize if my improvement would amount to an extra trick. but it does
woohoo!
forrest06/12/2020
play another trump when in w/ the A
but Mark can avoid that by not playing trumps in the first place
chuhchung06/12/2020
if they take the SQ with the A and play another trump, mark just claims right
forrest06/12/2020
yeah nvm
chuhchung06/12/2020
what's declarer's pain point on this hand?
what's the suit you want to attack
forrest06/12/2020
club to kill the entry is what makes sense to me but not seeing how that gains a trick
chuhchung06/12/2020
sorry the question is probably too vague
but we wanna hit hearts
but we can't, as long as dummy's trump is sentinel-ing
forrest06/12/2020
i see so we are ducking until dummy is out then
chuhchung06/12/2020
yes
duck the SQ
you wanna get into this habit as a matter of routine
now declarer has a problem
tries to draw trump? here come hearts
ok, ruff a heart first? now dummy is out of trumps, and you have to get to your hand to draw trumps still, and they'll tap you..... ugh
forrest06/12/2020
hmm but sometimes don't you want to win and play another to cut ruffs? Using the same logic as leading a trump. I guess if that's the case they are probably not drawing trumps
chuhchung06/12/2020
ducking is cutting the ruff, with the advantage of retaining the tempo (trump ace)
declarer has to twist to even get the ruff now, and it's not clear it's good for him

Lost out to the people playing in :3N:. Mostly feel like i'm going to make my 8 card major trumps, but i know if you have extra strength it often pays to play :3N:. Maybe if my DK is the DA instead?
chuhchung06/12/2020
i would always play 4H
everyone else is crazy

forrest06/12/2020
I think i should have just raised diamonds here
chuhchung06/12/2020
oh i saw this one
i think it's a practical call
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
forrest06/12/2020
fair enough - i do get a little mixed up on when 2NT can be a bare minimum and when it shows more
like 1 vs 2 level response that part makes sense
chuhchung06/12/2020
you should just agree to play it my way :stuck_out_tongue:
forrest06/12/2020
i guess if they overcall then it's stronger?
what's your way?
chuhchung06/12/2020
make opener's 2M rebid waiting
2N shows a real desire to declare NT
forrest06/12/2020
yeah that's how 2/1 usually works right?
2M doesn't show 6
chuhchung06/12/2020
there's no standard, heh
that's my preferred way
and std american should play it this way too
(even more compelling in std)
forrest06/12/2020
because we're not as strong so we stay lower/can be dropped?
although you said 2D promises a rebid
so nvm that second part
chuhchung06/12/2020
if you stick with the principle that the 2/1 bidder PROMISES a rebid, then 2M waiting is mandatory to allow responder to stop below game
assuming opener has a minimum
forrest06/12/2020
so if that's the case then I can rebid :2H: then Mark's :2N: and :3D:  and :3H: are NF, anything else is GF?
chuhchung06/12/2020
you mean if mark rebids 2N, then those things you said are NF? yeah
forrest06/12/2020
well that's not what i meant but that makes sense too
i'm saying for Mark's 2nd bid
chuhchung06/12/2020
i'm not really following
what's the auction?
forrest06/12/2020
:1H::2D:; :2H:
then which of these are NF
:2N:
:3D:
:3H:
chuhchung06/12/2020
oh yea all of them nf i think
but maybe that's bad
i'd want 3H F...
forrest06/12/2020
right that was the one that seemed least likely to me
ok i'll talk about it w/ Mark
I like it but it does make major rebids a little more complicated

forrest06/12/2020
I think you saw this one and confirmed I should :XX:?
chuhchung06/12/2020
yeah just rewind thids
balanced hands with values and 2 4 card suits like to rewind
they're just in deep shit here
forrest06/12/2020
so on this hand, E probably passes, Mark should pass too, then W has to bid :2D: then i whack it for penalties?
chuhchung06/12/2020
yeah
