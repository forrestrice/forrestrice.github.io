Welcome back! It's been over a year since my last post but bridge and life have continued apace. I spent the last couple days upgrading the site to use the [chirpy theme](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) which has nice tagging and categories support. I have some exciting bridge programming developments to announce in my next post!
